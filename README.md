A fun exercise which is always good Ruby practice, and could be seen on some whiteboarding challenges, is to re-implement an existing Ruby method. This morning, we are going to be re-implementing `#reverse` and `#flatten`.
Part 1: 
Create a file in a folder using `touch reverse.rb`
In that file, write a method that will take a string as an argument and return that string reversed. Something like this:
```
def my_reverse(string)
  # your code goes here
end
puts my_reverse("hello")
```
Then running the file by using a `ruby reverse.rb` should output to the screen, `olleh`
Testing is not required for this challenge. Think about some edge cases, and make sure that spaces also work.
Part 2:
re-implement `#flatten`
